  #### **Name**
Mana Curve Theory
  #### **Description**
    Design cards with a clear mana curve philosophy. In most TCGs, the
    "vanilla test" establishes baseline stats: a 2-mana creature should
    have roughly 2 power and 2 toughness (2/2). Deviations from this
    baseline must be paid for with drawbacks or gained through set mechanics.
    
    The classic mana curve for an aggro deck:
    - 1-drops: 8-12 cards
    - 2-drops: 8-10 cards
    - 3-drops: 6-8 cards
    - 4-drops: 2-4 cards
    - 5+ drops: 0-2 cards
    
    Control curves invert this, while midrange sits in between.
    
  #### **Example**
    // Mana cost to stats baseline (vanilla test)
    const vanillaStats = {
      1: { power: 1, toughness: 1, abilities: 0 },
      2: { power: 2, toughness: 2, abilities: 0 },
      3: { power: 3, toughness: 3, abilities: 0 },
      4: { power: 4, toughness: 4, abilities: 0 },
      5: { power: 5, toughness: 5, abilities: 0 },
      6: { power: 6, toughness: 6, abilities: 0 },
    };
    
    // Ability cost in "mana equivalents"
    const abilityCosts = {
      flying: 1.0,        // +1 mana worth of stats
      trample: 0.5,       // +0.5 mana
      haste: 1.0,         // +1 mana
      lifelink: 0.5,      // +0.5 mana
      deathtouch: 1.0,    // +1 mana
      hexproof: 1.5,      // +1.5 mana (very powerful)
      vigilance: 0.5,     // +0.5 mana
      menace: 0.5,        // +0.5 mana
      firstStrike: 0.75,  // +0.75 mana
      doubleStrike: 2.0,  // +2 mana (effectively doubles power)
      ward: 0.5,          // +0.5 mana per ward cost
    };
    
    // Example: A 3-mana 2/2 with flying is balanced
    // (3 mana base = 3/3 stats, flying costs 1 stat point = 2/2)
    function calculateCardCost(card) {
      let effectiveCost = card.manaCost;
      for (const ability of card.abilities) {
        effectiveCost -= abilityCosts[ability] || 0;
      }
      const expectedStats = vanillaStats[effectiveCost] || { power: 0, toughness: 0 };
      return {
        expectedPower: expectedStats.power,
        expectedToughness: expectedStats.toughness,
        actualPower: card.power,
        actualToughness: card.toughness,
        isBalanced: Math.abs(expectedStats.power - card.power) <= 1 &&
                    Math.abs(expectedStats.toughness - card.toughness) <= 1
      };
    }
    
  #### **Rationale**
Consistent mana-to-stats ratios create predictable power levels and enable meaningful deckbuilding decisions

Resource System Archetypes
  #### **Description**
    Choose a resource system that matches your design goals:
    
    1. LAND/MANA SYSTEM (Magic)
    - Cards in deck generate resources
    - Creates variance (mana screw/flood)
    - Enables multicolor deckbuilding decisions
    - Requires ~24/60 cards for resources
    
    2. RAMPING SYSTEM (Hearthstone)
    - Automatic resource gain each turn
    - Reduces variance, increases consistency
    - Games have predictable power curves
    - No "dead draws" for resources
    
    3. DISCARD FOR RESOURCES (Gwent, L5R)
    - Any card can become resources
    - Creates interesting decisions
    - No dead draws, high skill expression
    - Can feel bad to discard good cards
    
    4. ENERGY POOL (Pokemon)
    - Cards attached to specific units
    - Creates commitment decisions
    - Slower, more strategic gameplay
    - Unit-centric design
    
    5. HYBRID SYSTEMS
    - Mana dorks (creatures that make mana)
    - Treasure/Gold tokens
    - Cost reduction mechanics
    
  #### **Example**
    // Hearthstone-style ramping resource system
    class ManaSystem {
      constructor() {
        this.maxMana = 0;
        this.currentMana = 0;
        this.maxManaLimit = 10;
      }
    
      startTurn() {
        if (this.maxMana < this.maxManaLimit) {
          this.maxMana += 1;
        }
        this.currentMana = this.maxMana;
      }
    
      canAfford(cost) {
        return this.currentMana >= cost;
      }
    
      spend(cost) {
        if (!this.canAfford(cost)) return false;
        this.currentMana -= cost;
        return true;
      }
    }
    
    // Magic-style land system with variance tracking
    class LandManaSystem {
      constructor(deckSize = 60, landCount = 24) {
        this.landsInDeck = landCount;
        this.nonLandsInDeck = deckSize - landCount;
        this.landsInPlay = 0;
        this.landPlayedThisTurn = false;
      }
    
      // Probability of drawing N lands in opening hand of 7
      calculateLandProbability(landsWanted) {
        // Hypergeometric distribution
        return this.hypergeometric(
          this.landsInDeck + this.nonLandsInDeck,
          this.landsInDeck,
          7,
          landsWanted
        );
      }
    
      playLand() {
        if (this.landPlayedThisTurn) return false;
        this.landsInPlay += 1;
        this.landPlayedThisTurn = true;
        return true;
      }
    }
    
  #### **Rationale**
The resource system is the foundation of your game's feel - choose deliberately

Card Advantage Theory
  #### **Description**
    Card advantage is the fundamental concept that having more cards than
    your opponent generally leads to victory. Design must account for:
    
    VIRTUAL CARD ADVANTAGE
    - A 1-mana removal spell that kills a 5-mana creature
    - Equipment that survives when its wielder dies
    - Reusable abilities
    
    CARD PARITY
    - 2-for-1s: One card that answers/creates two things
    - Cantrips: Cards that replace themselves ("draw a card")
    - Modal cards: Multiple options increase effective card count
    
    TEMPO VS CARDS
    - Aggro decks trade cards for tempo (damage now)
    - Control decks trade tempo for cards (answers later)
    - Midrange balances both
    
  #### **Example**
    // Card advantage classification
    const cardAdvantageTypes = {
      // Pure card advantage - generates extra cards
      cantrip: {
        description: 'Replaces itself when played',
        example: 'Lightning Bolt that draws a card',
        advantage: '+0 net (card neutral)',
        designNote: 'Add 1-2 mana to base cost for cantrip'
      },
    
      twoForOne: {
        description: 'One card that affects two permanents',
        example: 'Destroy target creature and target enchantment',
        advantage: '+1 card',
        designNote: 'Premium effect, usually 4+ mana'
      },
    
      recursion: {
        description: 'Returns cards from discard',
        example: 'Return target creature from graveyard to hand',
        advantage: '+1 virtual card',
        designNote: 'Gate behind mana cost or conditions'
      },
    
      repeatable: {
        description: 'Can be used multiple times',
        example: 'Tap: Draw a card',
        advantage: '+N over game length',
        designNote: 'Most powerful type - heavy restrictions needed'
      }
    };
    
    // Card advantage costing formula
    function priceCardAdvantage(baseEffect, advantageType) {
      const premiums = {
        cantrip: 1.5,      // +1.5 mana for "draw a card"
        twoForOne: 2.0,    // +2 mana for affecting 2 things
        recursion: 1.0,    // +1 mana for graveyard return
        repeatable: 3.0,   // +3 mana minimum for repeatable effects
      };
    
      return baseEffect.manaCost + premiums[advantageType];
    }
    
  #### **Rationale**
Understanding card advantage prevents accidental broken cards and enables meaningful trade-off design

  #### **Name**
New World Order (NWO)
  #### **Description**
    New World Order is Magic's complexity management philosophy, applicable
    to any card game. The core insight: most complexity should be at higher
    rarities, with commons being simple and grokkable.
    
    COMPLEXITY BUDGET BY RARITY:
    - Common: 1 simple ability or vanilla stats
    - Uncommon: 1-2 abilities, can have synergy
    - Rare: 2-3 abilities, complex interactions OK
    - Mythic/Legendary: No limits, can be complex
    
    TYPES OF COMPLEXITY:
    1. Comprehension complexity - Hard to understand what card does
    2. Board complexity - Hard to track game state
    3. Strategic complexity - Hard to know when to play
    
    COMMON RULES (for ~60% of your cards):
    - No more than 3 lines of rules text
    - No "each opponent" or "all players" effects
    - No triggers that require constant tracking
    - No complex math during gameplay
    - Keywords OK if evergreen
    
  #### **Example**
    // NWO complexity scoring for commons
    const complexityFactors = {
      // Comprehension complexity
      linesOfText: {
        1: 0,
        2: 1,
        3: 2,
        4: 3, // Too complex for common
        5: 5  // Way too complex
      },
    
      // Board complexity
      triggeredAbility: 2,
      multipleTargets: 1,
      affectsAllPlayers: 3,
      createsTokens: 1,
      countersOnPermanents: 2,
    
      // Strategic complexity
      modalChoice: 1,
      conditionalEffect: 1,
      timingRestrictions: 1,
      requiresStackKnowledge: 3
    };
    
    function calculateComplexity(card) {
      let score = 0;
    
      // Text length
      const lines = card.rulesText.split('\n').length;
      score += complexityFactors.linesOfText[lines] || 5;
    
      // Check for complexity markers
      if (card.rulesText.includes('whenever')) score += complexityFactors.triggeredAbility;
      if (card.rulesText.includes('each opponent')) score += complexityFactors.affectsAllPlayers;
      if (card.rulesText.includes('or')) score += complexityFactors.modalChoice;
    
      return {
        score,
        appropriateRarity: score <= 3 ? 'common' :
                            score <= 5 ? 'uncommon' :
                            score <= 8 ? 'rare' : 'mythic'
      };
    }
    
  #### **Rationale**
Complexity at common makes games feel overwhelming and drives away new players

---
  #### **Name**
Keyword Design Philosophy
  #### **Description**
    Keywords package complexity into digestible chunks. Good keywords:
    
    1. EVERGREEN KEYWORDS (appear in every set)
    - Simple, intuitive meaning
    - Frequently useful in gameplay
    - Examples: Flying, Haste, Trample, Deathtouch
    
    2. SET MECHANICS (appear in one block)
    - Thematic to the set's world
    - Enable new strategies
    - Should be modular, not parasitic
    - Examples: Flashback, Kicker, Mutate
    
    KEYWORD DESIGN RULES:
    - If you have to explain it every time, it's not a good keyword
    - Keywords should compress complexity, not add it
    - Ability words (italicized) for thematic grouping without rules meaning
    - Avoid "keywordsoup" - too many keywords on one card
    
  #### **Example**
    // Keyword template structure
    const keywordDesign = {
      evergreen: {
        name: 'Flying',
        reminderText: 'This creature can only be blocked by creatures with flying or reach.',
        complexity: 'low',
        frequency: 'common',
        designNotes: [
          'Natural evasion mechanic',
          'Creates air/ground distinction',
          'Priced at +1 mana equivalent'
        ]
      },
    
      setMechanic: {
        name: 'Flashback',
        reminderText: 'You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.',
        complexity: 'medium',
        frequency: 'uncommon+',
        designNotes: [
          'Instant/Sorcery graveyard mechanic',
          'Creates card advantage over time',
          'Flashback cost usually higher than mana cost',
          'Works with self-mill strategies'
        ],
        parasitic: false,  // Works with any deck
        modular: true      // Each card stands alone
      },
    
      abilityWord: {
        name: 'Landfall',
        reminderText: null,  // Ability words have no rules meaning
        complexity: 'varies',
        frequency: 'varies',
        designNotes: [
          'Groups "whenever a land enters" effects',
          'Thematic - land exploration matters',
          'Not actually a keyword with rules meaning'
        ]
      }
    };
    
    // Keyword frequency guidelines per set
    const keywordAsAtTarget = {
      common: {
        evergreenKeywords: 'any',
        setMechanics: 1,           // Only one set mechanic at common
        keywordsPerCard: 1.5       // Average 1.5 keywords per common
      },
      uncommon: {
        evergreenKeywords: 'any',
        setMechanics: 2,
        keywordsPerCard: 2.0
      },
      rare: {
        evergreenKeywords: 'any',
        setMechanics: 'any',
        keywordsPerCard: 2.5
      }
    };
    
  #### **Rationale**
Keywords make games learnable - but too many keywords make games impenetrable

  #### **Name**
Set Skeleton Construction
  #### **Description**
    A set skeleton is the structural blueprint that ensures a set is
    draftable and has correct distribution of effects. Before designing
    individual cards, build the skeleton.
    
    TYPICAL SET SIZE (Standard expansion):
    - 101 commons (15 per color, 15 artifacts, 11 lands)
    - 80 uncommons (10-12 per color, rest split)
    - 53 rares (8-10 per color)
    - 15 mythic rares (2-3 per color)
    
    SKELETON SLOTS BY FUNCTION:
    - Creatures: 55-60% of cards
    - Removal: 8-12% of cards
    - Card draw: 5-8% of cards
    - Combat tricks: 5-8% of cards
    - Build-around: 3-5% of cards
    
    AS-FAN (How often a card type appears):
    - In a 15-card draft pack (10C, 3U, 1R, 1L):
    - Each common slot = 10/101 = 9.9% as-fan
    - Need ~2.5 flyers at common per color for healthy limited
    
  #### **Example**
    // Set skeleton template
    const setSkeletonTemplate = {
      // Per-color creature curve at common
      commonCreatures: {
        oneDrop: 1,
        twoDrop: 3,
        threeDrop: 3,
        fourDrop: 2,
        fivePlus: 2,
        // Total: 11 creatures per color at common
      },
    
      // Per-color spell distribution at common
      commonSpells: {
        removal: 1,        // 1 common removal per color
        combatTrick: 1,    // 1 trick per color
        cardDraw: 0.5,     // Shared across colors (blue gets 1)
        utility: 1.5,      // Varies by color identity
        // Total: 4 spells per color at common
      },
    
      // As-fan calculations
      asFanPerSlot: {
        commonSlot: 10 / 101,      // 9.9%
        uncommonSlot: 3 / 80,      // 3.75%
        rareSlot: 1 / (53 + 15),   // 1.47% (rare or mythic)
      },
    
      // Minimum as-fan targets for healthy limited
      asFanTargets: {
        flyingCreatures: 2.0,      // Per color
        removal: 1.5,              // Per color
        twoDropCreatures: 3.0,     // Per color
        colorFixing: 2.5,          // Total in pack
      }
    };
    
    // Calculate as-fan for a card category
    function calculateAsFan(commonCount, uncommonCount, rareCount) {
      return (commonCount * 10 / 101) +
              (uncommonCount * 3 / 80) +
              (rareCount * 1 / 68);
    }
    
    // Example: How often will I see common removal?
    // 5 colors * 1 common removal each = 5 common removal spells
    // As-fan = 5 * (10/101) = 0.495 removal spells per pack
    // This is too low! Need ~1.5 for healthy limited
    // Solution: Add uncommon/colorless removal
    
  #### **Rationale**
Without a skeleton, sets become unbalanced piles of cool cards that don't draft well

  #### **Name**
Draft Archetype Design
  #### **Description**
    Every draft format needs 10 two-color archetypes (one per color pair).
    Each archetype should have:
    
    1. SIGNPOST UNCOMMON
    - Clear, powerful card in both colors
    - Tells drafters "this is what WU does"
    - Example: UW Flyers gets a 2/3 flyer that draws when you attack with 3+ flyers
    
    2. BUILD-AROUND PAYOFFS
    - Rewards for being in the archetype
    - Scales with deck commitment
    - Usually at uncommon/rare
    
    3. ENABLERS
    - Commons that fit multiple archetypes
    - The glue cards that make decks work
    
    CLASSIC ARCHETYPE PATTERNS:
    - WU: Flyers/Control
    - UB: Control/Graveyard
    - BR: Aggro/Sacrifice
    - RG: Big Creatures/Ramp
    - GW: Go-Wide/Tokens
    - WB: Life/Death
    - UR: Spells Matter
    - BG: Graveyard/Value
    - RW: Aggro/Equipment
    - UG: Ramp/Card Advantage
    
  #### **Example**
    // Draft archetype definition template
    const archetypeDesign = {
      colorPair: 'WU',
      name: 'Tempo Flyers',
      strategy: 'Deploy efficient flyers, protect with countermagic, race',
    
      signpostUncommon: {
        name: 'Sky Captain',
        manaCost: 'WU',
        type: 'Creature - Human Soldier',
        stats: { power: 2, toughness: 3 },
        abilities: [
          'Flying',
          'Whenever you attack with three or more creatures with flying, draw a card.'
        ],
        designNotes: 'Clear signal for WU drafters, rewards archetype commitment'
      },
    
      keyCommons: [
        {
          name: 'Wind Drake',
          role: 'Efficient flyer',
          asFanNeeded: 2.0
        },
        {
          name: 'Essence Scatter',
          role: 'Tempo counter',
          asFanNeeded: 0.5
        },
        {
          name: 'Stormwing Entity',
          role: 'Payoff for spells + flyers',
          asFanNeeded: 0.3
        }
      ],
    
      keyUncommons: [
        'Serra Angel variant',
        'Draw-go finisher',
        'Bounce spell with upside'
      ],
    
      avoidInArchetype: [
        'High-cost ground creatures',
        'Equipment without evasion',
        'Cards requiring board stalls'
      ],
    
      weakTo: ['BG midrange', 'Mass removal', 'Reach creatures'],
      strongAgainst: ['RG ramp', 'Ground-based aggro']
    };
    
  #### **Rationale**
Clear archetypes make drafting learnable and give each color pair a distinct identity

Constructed Archetype Triangle
  #### **Description**
    Healthy constructed metagames have a rock-paper-scissors dynamic:
    
    AGGRO beats CONTROL
    - Faster than control can stabilize
    - Punishes slow starts and card draw
    
    CONTROL beats MIDRANGE
    - Out-values midrange threats
    - Has answers for everything
    
    MIDRANGE beats AGGRO
    - Bigger creatures trade favorably
    - Stabilizes before death
    
    COMBO breaks this but loses to:
    - Fast aggro (dies before combo)
    - Discard/counterspells (disruption)
    
    DESIGN LEVERS:
    - Aggro speed (how fast can it kill?)
    - Control stabilization (when can it survive?)
    - Midrange efficiency (how good is each card?)
    - Combo consistency (how often does it work?)
    
  #### **Example**
    // Archetype design parameters
    const archetypeDesignTargets = {

  #### **Rationale**
Without archetype diversity, metagames become solved and stale

Digital-First Design
  #### **Description**
    Digital card games can do things paper cannot. Design for the medium:
    
    DIGITAL ADVANTAGES:
    - Random number generation (true randomness)
    - Hidden information (hand size without counting)
    - Automatic rule enforcement
    - History tracking (cards seen, damage dealt)
    - Animation and feedback
    - Dynamic cost adjustment
    
    DIGITAL MECHANICS:
    - Discover: Choose from random subset of cards
    - Transform: Card changes permanently
    - Dormant: Automatic wake-up triggers
    - Start of Game effects: Shuffle deck modifications
    
    DIGITAL PITFALLS:
    - Turn length limits (rope timers)
    - UI complexity limits
    - Memory/storage of game state
    - Mobile screen constraints

  #### **Name**
Print Production Considerations
  #### **Description**
    Physical card games have constraints digital doesn't:
    
    CARD STOCK:
    - Blue core vs black core (cheating prevention)
    - 300 GSM+ for premium feel
    - Finish: Matte (shuffles well) vs Gloss (pops visually)
    
    CUTTING:
    - Rounded corners (3mm radius standard)
    - Bleed area (3mm minimum)
    - Safe zone (keep text 3mm from edge)
    
    COLOR:
    - CMYK printing (no true RGB neons)
    - Color matching across print runs
    - Foil stamping for premium cards (expensive)
    
    PACK CONFIGURATION:
    - Collation algorithms (no duplicate rares in box)
    - Rare distribution (1:8 packs for rare, 1:8 rares for mythic)
    - Print sheet efficiency (11x11 or 10x11 grids)
    
  #### **Example**
    // Card print specifications
    const printSpecs = {
      dimensions: {
        standard: { width: 63, height: 88, unit: 'mm' }, // Poker size
        mini: { width: 44, height: 63, unit: 'mm' },
        tarot: { width: 70, height: 121, unit: 'mm' }
      },

        bleedArea: 3,    // mm outside trim line
        safeZone: 3,     // mm inside trim line
        cornerRadius: 3  // mm radius for rounded corners
      },
    
      cardStock: {
        thickness: 320,   // GSM (grams per square meter)
        core: 'blue',     // Blue core prevents light shining through
        finish: 'linen',  // Options: matte, gloss, linen, silk
        coating: 'aqueous' // Water-based, environmentally friendly
      },
    
      colorMode: 'CMYK',  // Print uses CMYK, not RGB
    
      // Pack configuration
      boosterPack: {
        commons: 10,
        uncommons: 3,

        land: 1,          // Basic land or foil
        mythicRate: 1/8   // 1 in 8 rare slots is mythic
      },
    
      // Print sheet efficiency
      printSheet: {
        cardsPerSheet: 121,  // 11x11 grid
        sheetsPerBox: 6,
        boxesPerCase: 4,
        colorsPerSheet: 1    // Each sheet is single color
      }

    // Validate card is print-ready
    function validatePrintReady(cardDesign) {
      const issues = [];
    
      if (cardDesign.textFromEdge < 3) {
        issues.push('Text too close to edge - may be cut off');
      }
    
      if (cardDesign.usesRGB) {

        issues.push('Neon colors cannot be printed in CMYK');
      }
    
      return { isReady: issues.length === 0, issues };
    }
    
  #### **Rationale**
Beautiful digital designs can become unreadable physical cards without production awareness

## Anti-Patterns


---
  #### **Name**
Power Creep Spiral
  #### **Description**
    Each set making cards stronger than the last, invalidating older cards.
    This is the death spiral of card games.
    
  #### **Why**
    Players feel betrayed when their collection becomes worthless. New player
    entry cost skyrockets. Game becomes about who bought the latest set.
    Eventually the power level is absurd and nothing feels impactful.
    
  #### **Bad Example**
    // Set 1: 2-mana 2/2 is premium
    // Set 2: 2-mana 2/2 with upside is premium
    // Set 3: 2-mana 3/3 with upside is premium
    // Set 4: 2-mana 3/3 with two upsides is premium
    // Result: Set 1 cards are unplayable garbage
    
  #### **Good Example**
    // Lateral design instead of power creep
    // Set 1: 2-mana 2/2 - baseline for aggro
    // Set 2: 2-mana 1/3 - baseline for control (same power, different role)
    // Set 3: 2-mana 2/2 with "enters tapped" - powerful ability, drawback
    // Set 4: 2-mana 2/1 with haste - trades stats for speed
    // Result: All cards are viable in different contexts
    
  #### **Consequence**
Power creep kills games - players leave when their collection becomes worthless

---
  #### **Name**
Parasitic Mechanics
  #### **Description**
    Mechanics that only work with cards from the same set, not with the
    broader card pool.
    
  #### **Why**
    Parasitic mechanics create isolated islands in your card pool. Cards
    from the parasitic set can't be mixed with other strategies, reducing
    deckbuilding options and replayability.
    
  #### **Bad Example**
    // Parasitic: Cards only work with each other
    // Arcane spells in Kamigawa - only Arcane triggers Splice
    // Splice onto Arcane - useless without Arcane spells
    // Spirit tribal - only works with Spirit creature type
    // Result: Entire mechanic is only playable with itself
    
  #### **Good Example**
    // Modular: Works with entire card pool
    // Flashback: Works with any instant/sorcery deck
    // Kicker: Works on any card, enables flexibility
    // Landfall: Works with any land in the game
    // Result: Mechanic enhances existing strategies
    
  #### **Consequence**
Parasitic mechanics create dead sets that no one wants to draft or open

---
  #### **Name**
Mandatory Staples
  #### **Description**
    Cards so powerful they must be in every deck of that color/strategy,
    eliminating deckbuilding diversity.
    
  #### **Why**
    If every blue deck must play "Cancel Plus", then blue deck diversity
    collapses. Players feel forced, not creative. Metagames become about
    who draws their staples first.
    
  #### **Bad Example**
    // Must-include staple
    name: "Obviously Broken Draw Spell"
    cost: 1U
    text: "Draw 3 cards."
    // Result: Every blue deck plays 4 of these. Not playing them is incorrect.
    
  #### **Good Example**
    // Contextual alternatives
    // Card A: Draw 2, can't attack this turn (control)
    // Card B: Draw 1, creature gets +1/+1 (tempo)
    // Card C: Draw 3, discard 2 (graveyard strategies)
    // Result: Players choose based on strategy, not obvious power
    
  #### **Consequence**
Staples reduce deck diversity to 'play staples + 5 flex slots'

  #### **Name**
Unfun Counter-Play
  #### **Description**
    Mechanics that prevent opponent from playing the game without
    providing engaging interaction.
    
  #### **Why**
    Players want to play their cards. "You can't play" mechanics
    (land destruction, hand destruction, turn skipping) create
    non-games where one player watches helplessly.
    
  #### **Bad Example**
    // Non-game mechanics
    const unfunMechanics = [
      'Destroy all lands',           // Opponent can't cast spells
      'Opponent discards hand',      // No decisions to make
      'Skip opponent next turn',     // Literal non-game
      'Counter spell, draw card',    // Free 2-for-1 counterspell
      'Opponent can\'t attack'       // Shuts down creature decks entirely
    ];
    
  #### **Good Example**
    // Interactive alternatives
    const funCounterplay = [
      'Opponent sacrifices a land',   // One land, not all
      'Look at hand, choose discard', // Targeted, skill-testing
      'Tap opponent creatures',       // Temporary, not permanent
      'Counter spell OR draw card',   // Modal choice, not both
      'Attacking creatures get -2/-0' // Answers but doesn't lock out
    ];
    
  #### **Consequence**
Unfun mechanics make players quit - being locked out feels terrible

  #### **Name**
Coin Flip Finishers
  #### **Description**
    Game-ending cards determined entirely by luck, removing skill
    from the resolution.
    
  #### **Why**
    If the game ends on a coin flip, why did the preceding 15 turns
    matter? Randomness in setup/draw is accepted; randomness in
    resolution feels like stolen games.
    
  #### **Bad Example**
    // Pure luck finisher
    name: "Ultimate Coinflip"
    cost: 10
    text: "Flip a coin. If heads, you win. If tails, you lose."
    // Result: Entire game decided by luck at the end
    
  #### **Good Example**
    // Randomness with mitigation
    name: "Risky Gambit"
    cost: 5
    text: "Flip a coin. Heads: Deal 10 damage. Tails: Deal 5 damage."
    // Result: Random but never game-losing. Skill in when to play it.
    
    // OR: Controlled randomness
    name: "Calculated Risk"
    cost: 4
    text: "Deal X damage where X is the result of two dice. You may reroll once."
    // Result: Variance exists but reroll adds player agency
    
  #### **Consequence**
Coin flip finishers make players feel like skill doesn't matter

  #### **Name**
Rules Text Novels
  #### **Description**
    Cards with so much text they require a law degree to understand.
    Often happens when designers patch edge cases inline.
    
  #### **Why**
    Reading a novel during gameplay breaks flow. Players misunderstand
    complex cards, leading to feel-bad moments and judge calls.
    Complexity should be emergent, not in-card.
    
  #### **Bad Example**
    // Text soup
    name: "Confusing Contraption"
    text: |
      When Confusing Contraption enters the battlefield, if you control
      another artifact and it's your main phase and you didn't play a
      land this turn, you may pay 2 life. If you do, target creature
      gets -2/-2 until end of turn. Otherwise, if you control three or
      more artifacts, you may instead draw a card. If the creature that
      got -2/-2 dies this turn and it was a non-token creature, create
      a 1/1 Thopter artifact creature token with flying.
    
  #### **Good Example**
    // Clean design
    name: "Simple Artifact"
    text: |
      When this enters, choose one:
      - Pay 2 life: Target creature gets -2/-2.
      - Draw a card.
    // Result: Same decision space, 1/4 the words
    
  #### **Consequence**
Wall of text cards don't get played - they're too annoying to parse

---
  #### **Name**
Linear Mechanics
  #### **Description**
    Mechanics that only have one correct way to build around them,
    removing deckbuilding creativity.
    
  #### **Why**
    If mechanic X only works in deck Y, there's no creativity.
    Players solve the deck once and never explore again.
    Good mechanics have multiple viable approaches.
    
  #### **Bad Example**
    // Linear: One correct build
    mechanic: "Storm" // Count spells this turn, copy effect that many times
    // Result: Always play fast mana + cheap spells + storm finisher
    // There's only one Storm deck, ever
    
  #### **Good Example**
    // Open-ended: Multiple valid builds
    mechanic: "Flashback" // Cast from graveyard
    // Builds: Self-mill, Control, Tempo, Combo
    // Many different decks use flashback differently
    
  #### **Consequence**
Linear mechanics create 'solved' formats where exploration dies
